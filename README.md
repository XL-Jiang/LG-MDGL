(1) The L-MDGL module captured the local spatiotemporal dynamics within a single time window by temporal convolution constructs, while the G-MDGL module captured the global spatiotemporal dynamics with global cross-scale topological dynamic fusion. 

(2) LG-MDGL extracted complex brain dynamic features from BFCNs based on multi-templatesscale, while the brain attention readout (BARO) identifieddiscovered discriminative ROI s related to neurodevelopmental disorders. 

(3) LG-MDGL was validated on the publicly available ABIDE-II and ADHD-200 datasets. The experimental results demonstrated its superiority over some state-of-the-art methods for ASD and ADHD diagnosis. The fusion of global graph features and non-imaging features further improved diagnostic accuracy.
